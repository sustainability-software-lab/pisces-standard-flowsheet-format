    val_dataset=val_dataset,
    batch_size=8,
    learning_rate=0.001,
    device='cuda'
)

history = trainer.train(
    num_epochs=200,
    early_stopping_patience=20
)
```

### Phase 4: Weighted Scoring System ✅

**Modules Created:**
- `src/evaluation/metrics.py` - Standard and weighted metrics
- `src/evaluation/weighted_scorer.py` - Importance-weighted evaluation

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Multiple weighting strategies:
  - `installed_cost` - Weight by equipment cost
  - `power_consumption` - Weight by energy use
  - `heat_duty` - Weight by thermal load
  - `custom` - User-defined function
  
- ✅ Comprehensive metrics:
  - Standard: MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE, R²
  - Weighted: Weighted MAE, MSE, RMSE
  
- ✅ Per-process breakdown
- ✅ High-error component identification
- ✅ Detailed evaluation reports

**Why Weighted Scoring?**

Standard metrics treat all errors equally, but in engineering:
- Errors on expensive equipment matter more
- Energy-intensive units deserve more attention
- Critical process steps need accurate predictions

**Example:**
```python
scorer = WeightedScorer(weight_by='installed_cost')
results = scorer.evaluate_with_breakdown(model, test_dataset, device)

# Overall scores
print(results['overall_scores'])

# Per-process breakdown
for process in results['process_breakdown']:
    print(f"Process {process['process_id']}: "
          f"Error = {process['relative_error']:.2f}%, "
          f"Importance = {process['importance_weight']:.3f}")
```

### Phase 5: Inference and LLM Interpretation ✅

**Modules Created:**
- `src/inference/predictor.py` - Make predictions and generate explanations
- `src/inference/gemini_explainer.py` - Natural language explanations via Gemini

**Predictor Features:**
- ✅ Single and batch predictions
- ✅ Attention weight extraction
- ✅ Important stream identification
- ✅ High-cost node analysis
- ✅ Process complexity metrics
- ✅ Comprehensive explanation dictionaries

**Gemini Explainer Features:**
- ✅ Natural language explanations

- ✅ Cost driver analysis
- ✅ Improvement suggestions
- ✅ Feature extraction from text (for unstructured inputs)

**Example Output:**

```
Prediction Analysis:
================================================================================
Predicted cost: $45,200,000
Actual cost: $47,100,000
Error: 4.03%

Process complexity:
  Units: 54
  Streams: 96

Top 3 important streams (by attention):
  1. Unit 15 → Unit 16 (attention: 0.1234)
  2. Unit 25 → Unit 26 (attention: 0.0987)
  3. Unit 8 → Unit 15 (attention: 0.0856)
```

**Gemini Explanation:**

```
The GNN model predicts a total installed cost of $45.2M for this 
sugarcane-to-ethanol process, showing strong accuracy with only 4% 
error. Key cost drivers include the fermentation reactors (Units 15-18, 
~$8M) and distillation columns (Units 25-28, ~$6M). The attention 
mechanism highlights the sugar extraction stream as critical, 
suggesting that optimizing upstream processing could yield significant 
savings. Consider integrating heat recovery between fermentation and 
distillation to reduce utility costs.

## 📈 Expected Performance

On the bioindustrial park dataset (11 flowsheets):

```
Training Set:   R² ~ 0.95, MAE ~ $2.0M
Validation Set: R² ~ 0.89, MAE ~ $2.5M
Test Set:       R² ~ 0.87, MAE ~ $2.8M
```

**Note:** With only 11 samples, some overfitting is expected. Performance will improve with more data.

---

## 🛠️ Customization Options

### 1. Change Target Variable
```python
dataset = graph_builder.build_dataset(
    flowsheets,
    target_type='total_power_consumption'  # or 'total_purchase_cost'
)
```

### 2. Adjust Model Architecture
```yaml
model:
  hidden_channels: 128  # Increase capacity
  num_gat_layers: 3     # Add depth
  heads: 8              # More attention heads
```

### 3. Custom Weight Function
```python
def my_weights(data):
    # Combine cost and energy
    features = data.x.numpy()
    return 0.7 * features[:, 1] + 0.3 * features[:, 3]

scorer = WeightedScorer(weight_by='custom', weight_function=my_weights)
```

### 4. Multi-Task Learning
Modify model output_dim and loss function to predict multiple targets.

## 🚧 Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations
1. **Small Dataset**: Only 11 flowsheets (need 50-100+ for robust learning)
2. **Single Target**: Predicts one variable at a time
3. **Static Graphs**: Doesn't model dynamic/time-series behavior
4. **Local Scope**: Trained on bioindustrial processes only

### Future Enhancements
1. **More Data**: Export additional BioSTEAM flowsheets
2. **Multi-Task**: Predict cost, energy, emissions simultaneously
3. **Transfer Learning**: Pre-train on large dataset, fine-tune on specific processes
4. **Graph Generation**: Generate novel process configurations
5. **Optimization Loop**: Use GNN predictions in process optimization
6. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Bayesian GNNs or deeper ensembles
7. **Dynamic Modeling**: Temporal GNNs for process dynamics

        power_consumption,
        heat_duty,
